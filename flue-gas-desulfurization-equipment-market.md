<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flue-gas Desulfurization Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet FGD</li><li>Dry & Semi-Dry FGD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) equipment consists of three major types: wet FGD, dry FGD, and semi-dry FGD. Wet FGD systems use a wet scrubbing process to remove sulfur dioxide from flue gas, resulting in a waste stream of slurry. Dry FGD systems use a dry reaction process to remove sulfur dioxide, producing a dry waste product. Semi-dry FGD systems combine elements of both wet and dry processes. Each type of FGD system has its own advantages and limitations, depending on factors such as cost, efficiency, and environmental impact.</p></p>
