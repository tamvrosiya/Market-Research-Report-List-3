<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Trailer Brake Controllers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Proportional Brake Controllers</li><li>Time-Delayed Brake Controllers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Proportional brake controllers apply the trailer brakes with a force proportional to the vehicle's deceleration, ensuring a smooth and consistent braking experience. Time-delayed brake controllers have a preset delay between when the brake pedal is pressed and when the trailer brakes are engaged. Proportional brake controllers offer more precise braking control and are ideal for heavy or frequent towing. Time-delayed brake controllers are simpler and less expensive, making them suitable for light to moderate towing needs.</p></p>
