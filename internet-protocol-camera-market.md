<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Internet Protocol Camera Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centralized Internet Protocol Camera</li><li>Decentralized Internet Protocol Camera</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Internet Protocol Camera market can be divided into two main types: Centralized and Decentralized. Centralized IP cameras require a central network video recorder (NVR) to store and manage video footage, making them ideal for large-scale surveillance systems. On the other hand, Decentralized IP cameras have built-in storage and processing capabilities, allowing them to function independently without the need for a central NVR. Decentralized cameras are often used in smaller installations or where a more flexible and scalable solution is required.</p></p>
