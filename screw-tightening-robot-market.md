<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Screw Tightening Robot Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cartesian Robot</li><li>SCARA Robot</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Screw tightening robots are commonly used in industrial settings for automation. Cartesian robots are a type of screw tightening robot that operate in a linear motion along three perpendicular axes, providing precise and accurate tightening capabilities. SCARA robots, on the other hand, use a combination of rotational and linear movements to tighten screws quickly and efficiently in a circular or oval workspace. Both types of robots offer unique advantages in different applications, with Cartesian robots being more suitable for linear operations and SCARA robots for circular operations.</p></p>
