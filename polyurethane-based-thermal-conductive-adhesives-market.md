<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyurethane Based Thermal Conductive Adhesives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Isotropic</li><li>Anisotropic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polyurethane-based thermal conductive adhesives come in two main types: isotropic and anisotropic. Isotropic adhesives have uniform thermal conductivity properties in all directions, making them ideal for applications requiring efficient heat transfer without the need for specific alignment. On the other hand, anisotropic adhesives have varying thermal conductivity properties depending on the direction, allowing for heat transfer in specific directions. This makes them suitable for applications that require targeted heat dissipation or insulation. Both types offer different benefits depending on the specific needs of the application.</p></p>
