<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Wind Tunnel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed Circuit</li><li>Open Circuit</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive wind tunnels are used to simulate the effects of airflow on vehicles for testing purposes. There are two main types of automotive wind tunnels: closed circuit and open circuit. Closed circuit wind tunnels recirculate air within a contained loop, allowing for consistent testing conditions. Open circuit wind tunnels draw in fresh air from the surrounding environment, providing a more realistic simulation of real-world driving conditions. Both types have their own advantages and are utilized based on the specific testing needs of manufacturers and researchers.</p></p>
