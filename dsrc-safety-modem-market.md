<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The DSRC Safety Modem Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active DSRC</li><li>Passive DSRC</li></ul></p>
<p><p>DSRC safety modems are used in vehicles for communication with other vehicles and infrastructure to improve road safety. Active DSRC modems actively transmit and receive signals, allowing for real-time communication and collision avoidance. Passive DSRC modems only receive signals and do not actively transmit, making them more limited in functionality but still useful for receiving important safety information. Both types of modems play a crucial role in enhancing road safety through vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication.</p></p>
