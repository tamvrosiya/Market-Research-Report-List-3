<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Potassium Sulphate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Powder SOP</li><li>Granular SOP</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Potassium sulphate, also known as SOP, is available in two main market types: Powder SOP and Granular SOP. Powder SOP is finely ground and easily soluble, making it suitable for applications where quick nutrient absorption is required. Granular SOP, on the other hand, is more slow-release and is commonly used for long-term crop nutrition. Both types of SOP offer valuable potassium and sulphur nutrients for plant growth, but they cater to different needs in terms of application and nutrient release characteristics.</p></p>
