<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Multi-Wavelength Laser Module Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multimode</li><li>Single-mode</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Multi-Wavelength Laser Modules are available in two market types: Multimode and Single-mode. Multimode laser modules use a larger core size which allows multiple wavelengths to travel through the fiber at the same time, making them ideal for short-distance applications. Single-mode laser modules have a smaller core size and only allow one wavelength to travel through the fiber with minimal dispersion, making them suitable for long-distance communication. Both market types offer unique advantages depending on the specific application requirements.</p></p>
