<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rubber Flame Retardants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Organic Halogen Flame Retardant</li><li>Organic Phosphorus Flame Retardant</li><li>Inorganic Flame Retardant</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rubber flame retardants are classified into three main types - organic halogen flame retardants, organic phosphorus flame retardants, and inorganic flame retardants. Organic halogen flame retardants are chemicals that contain halogen atoms like chlorine or bromine. Organic phosphorus flame retardants use phosphorus-based compounds to slow down the spread of fire. Inorganic flame retardants, on the other hand, are minerals or metals that can be incorporated into rubber materials to make them less flammable. Each type of flame retardant offers different levels of fire protection for rubber products.</p></p>
