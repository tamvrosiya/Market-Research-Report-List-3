<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Regenerative Desiccant Dryers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heatless</li><li>Heated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Regenerative desiccant dryers are commonly classified into two main types: heatless and heated. Heatless dryers use compressed air to provide the necessary heat for regeneration, while heated dryers require an external source of heat, such as electricity or natural gas. Heatless dryers are more energy-efficient but have a slower regeneration process, while heated dryers are faster but consume more energy. Both types have their advantages and are chosen based on the specific needs of the application.</p></p>
