<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Marine Shock Absorber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Elastomer</li><li>Plastic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Marine shock absorbers are designed to reduce the impact of waves and rough waters on marine vessels. There are two main types of shock absorbers in the market - elastomer and plastic. Elastomer shock absorbers use rubber or polymer materials to absorb and dissipate the energy from impacts, providing a cushioning effect. Plastic shock absorbers are made from high-strength plastics that can withstand the harsh marine environment and provide effective shock absorption. Both types offer durability and reliability in marine applications.</p></p>
