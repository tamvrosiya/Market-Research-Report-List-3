<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Handheld Ultrasonic Flow Meter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Clamp</li><li>Clip-on</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Handheld Ultrasonic Flow Meter market can be divided into two main types: Clamp and Clip-on. Clamp-on flow meters are designed to be installed around existing pipes without the need for cutting or interrupting the flow. They use clamps to secure the sensor in place and measure the flow rate based on the ultrasonic signal. Clip-on flow meters, on the other hand, involve attaching a sensor directly onto the outside of the pipe with a clip. Both types offer non-invasive and convenient solutions for measuring flow rates in various industrial applications.</p></p>
