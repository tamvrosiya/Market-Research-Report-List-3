<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Shake Tables Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multi-axis Shake Table</li><li>Single-axis Shake Table</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Shake tables are essential tools in earthquake engineering to simulate the effects of earthquakes on structures. There are two main types of shake tables: Multi-axis Shake Table and Single-axis Shake Table. Multi-axis shake tables can simulate multiple directions of ground motion simultaneously, allowing for more realistic testing. Single-axis shake tables, on the other hand, can only simulate motion along one direction. Both types of shake tables play a crucial role in testing the strength and durability of structures under seismic conditions.</p></p>
