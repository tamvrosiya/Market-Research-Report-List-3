<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Scooter Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tubeless Tires</li><li>Tubed Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electric scooter tires come in two main types: tubeless tires and tubed tires. Tubeless tires do not require an inner tube to hold the air, as the tire itself creates an airtight seal with the rim. This design reduces the risk of punctures and makes for easier maintenance. On the other hand, tubed tires require an inner tube to hold the air, which can be more prone to punctures but easier to repair. Both types have their advantages and are popular choices in the electric scooter market.</p></p>
