<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyimide Plastic Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermosetting</li><li>Thermoplastic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polyimide plastic can be categorized into two main types: thermosetting and thermoplastic. Thermosetting polyimide plastics are initially in a soft and moldable state that can be shaped into the desired form, but once they are heated and cured, they undergo a chemical change that results in a rigid and durable final product. In contrast, thermoplastic polyimide plastics can be reheated and remolded multiple times without undergoing any chemical change, making them ideal for applications requiring flexibility and reshaping capabilities.</p></p>
