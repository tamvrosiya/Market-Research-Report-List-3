<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Incandescent Lamps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fluorescent</li><li>Halogen</li><li>Incandescent</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Incandescent Lamps: These are traditional light bulbs that produce light by heating a wire filament until it glows. They are known for their warm light but are less energy-efficient compared to other types of lamps.</p><p>Fluorescent Lamps: These lamps use electricity to excite mercury vapor, producing UV light that then stimulates a phosphor coating inside the bulb to produce visible light. They are more energy-efficient than incandescent lamps.</p><p>Halogen Lamps: These lamps use a tungsten filament similar to incandescent lamps, but are filled with halogen gas, allowing them to operate at higher temperatures and produce brighter light.</p><p>Others: This category includes various types of lamps such as LED lamps, compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs), and metal halide lamps, each offering different features and benefits.</p></p>
