<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Duct Smoke Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Photoelectric</li><li>Ionization</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Duct smoke detectors are a type of smoke detector specifically designed for use in HVAC systems. There are two main types of duct smoke detectors: photoelectric and ionization. Photoelectric duct smoke detectors use a beam of light to detect smoke particles, while ionization duct smoke detectors use a small amount of radioactive material to ionize air molecules and detect smoke particles. Both types of detectors are commonly used in commercial buildings to provide early detection of smoke and fire in HVAC systems.</p></p>
