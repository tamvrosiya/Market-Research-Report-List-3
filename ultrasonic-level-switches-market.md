<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultrasonic Level Switches Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Externally Mounted</li><li>Non Externally Mounted</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ultrasonic level switches can be categorized into two main types: externally mounted and non-externally mounted. Externally mounted switches are installed outside of the container or vessel being monitored, making them suitable for harsh or corrosive environments. Non-externally mounted switches are installed directly into the liquid or solid material, providing more accurate measurements and requiring less maintenance. Both types offer reliable level sensing capabilities, but the choice between them depends on the specific application requirements and environmental conditions.</p></p>
