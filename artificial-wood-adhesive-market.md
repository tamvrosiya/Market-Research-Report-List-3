<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Wood Adhesive Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Natural Adhesive</li><li>Synthetic Adhesive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Artificial wood adhesives can be divided into two main types: Natural Adhesive and Synthetic Adhesive. Natural adhesives are derived from renewable resources such as plant-based materials like starch, soy, or natural resins. These adhesives are non-toxic and environmentally friendly. On the other hand, synthetic adhesives are chemically manufactured and are often stronger and more durable than natural adhesives. They are commonly used in industrial applications where high strength and water resistance are required. Both types of adhesives play a crucial role in the artificial wood industry.</p></p>
